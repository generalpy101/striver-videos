# Recursion is when a function calls itself until a specified condition is met
# Example:
'''
def main(i):
    print(i)
    main(i+1)   
'''
# Above is an example of a recursive function.
# It will print the value of i and then call itself again with i+1's value
# This will continue until the program crashes. Infinite recursion like infinite loop
